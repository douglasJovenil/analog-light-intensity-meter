# Analog Light Intensity Meter

Circuit project of a light intensity meter without use of microcontrollers. The main ideia was to develop a circuito using only basics eletronics components as LDR, LED, resistors and opamps to create a ADC to read the voltage on LDR. Besides that, we have 9 LED's indicantig the light intensity, where 9 LED's on means a high luminosity and all LED's off means a low luminosity.

## üèÉ Usage

To see this meter working you have to options:

- Simulate
- Circuit on a protoboard

### Simulate

- You must to have [Proteus Professional](https://www.labcenter.com/downloads) installed on your computer
- Clone this repository with the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/douglasJovenil/analog-light-intensity-meter
```

- On **Proteus** open **lightIntensityMeter.pdsprj**, you find this file inside the repository you just cloned
- With the project open just click on **Run the simulation** button
