# Analog Light Intensity Meter

A light intensity meter without using microcontrollers. The main idea is to develop a circuit using only basics electronics components such as LDRs, LEDs, resistors and op-amps to create an ADC to read the voltage on the LDR. There's also 9 LEDs indicating the light intensity, where 9 LEDs on means a high luminosity and all LEDs off means a low luminosity.
